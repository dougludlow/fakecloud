//! CloudFormation-driven real task backing for ECS services.
//!
//! When `AWS::ECS::Service` is provisioned through a CloudFormation stack, the
//! CFN provisioner inserts the service record synchronously (so `Ref`/`GetAtt`
//! resolve during provisioning) with `running_count` 0 and no tasks, then asks
//! ECS to launch the REAL tasks needed to reach `desiredCount` -- the same
//! container-backed tasks the direct `CreateService` path spawns. This module
//! mirrors that background task launch for an already-inserted service, so a
//! CFN-provisioned ECS service runs genuine containers, not phantom metadata.
