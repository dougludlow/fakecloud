// crates/fakecloud-cloudfront/src/dataplane.rs
//! In-process CloudFront data plane.
//!
//! Distributions are served on fakecloud's **main `--addr` listener**, routed by
//! the request `Host` header, rather than on a per-distribution ephemeral port.
//! [`CloudFrontDataPlane::serve`] is installed as an outer middleware on the main
//! axum router: it matches the `Host` header against every enabled distribution's
//! `DomainName` (`<id>.cloudfront.net`) or one of its alternate domain names
//! (`Aliases`/CNAMEs). A match is served as viewer traffic; anything else (the AWS
//! API, `/_fakecloud/*`, health) is handed straight back for normal dispatch.
//!
//! This is how real CloudFront works -- a distribution is reached by its domain,
//! not a port -- and it means a distribution is reachable from outside a container
//! whenever the main port is published (`-p`), with no second listener to expose.
//! Clients discover which distributions are served, and the domain to send as
//! `Host`, via `/_fakecloud/cloudfront/distributions`.
//!
//! Once a request is matched to a distribution, [`serve`](CloudFrontDataPlane::serve)
//! selects a cache behavior by path pattern, resolves its origin, reverse-proxies
//! to it, and applies CustomErrorResponses (e.g. the SPA `404 -> /index.html`
//! served as `200`). There is no global edge network -- this is a single local
//! origin-serving node, matching the ALB/API Gateway precedent. Deferred (not
//! implemented): in-path CloudFront Functions / Lambda@Edge and TTL caching /
//! invalidation.
//!
//! S3 origins live in this same process, so they are fetched in-process,
//! dispatched straight into the S3 service rather than over a socket or through
//! the HTTP router: a viewer path is always an object key in the origin bucket,
//! never one of fakecloud's own routes (`/_fakecloud/*`, IMDS, ...). That is
//! also how private S3 origins work: an origin with an origin access control
//! (`OriginAccessControlId`, honoring its `SigningBehavior`) is fetched as the
//! `cloudfront.amazonaws.com` service principal with `aws:SourceArn` = the
//! distribution ARN and `aws:SourceAccount` = its owner, and one with a legacy
//! origin access identity (`S3OriginConfig.OriginAccessIdentity`) as that OAI,
//! so under IAM enforcement the bucket policy decides exactly as in AWS. The
//! identity rides a request extension ([`InternalCaller`]) that no client can
//! set. Origins with neither are fetched anonymously.
